1. Navigation Introduction in Flutter
Navigation is the process of moving between different screens (routes) in a Flutter app. In mobile
apps, each screen is typically represented by a Widget. Flutter provides a powerful navigation
system that allows you to manage the stack of screens, move forward, go back, and pass data between
screens.

Why is navigation important?

Enables multi-screen apps
Manages user flow and app state
Handles deep linking and complex flows

2.Navigator and Root
   What is the Navigator?
   The Navigator is a widget that manages a stack of Route objects.
   It allows you to push (navigate to) and pop (go back from) routes (screens).
   The stack-based approach means the last screen pushed is the first to be popped (LIFO).
   Basic Example:

Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()));
Navigator.pop(context); // Go back
What is the Root?
The root of your app is typically a MaterialApp or CupertinoApp widget.
The home property or initialRoute defines the first screen (route) shown.
The root Navigator is created by the app and manages all navigation unless you use nested
navigators.

3.Navigation in Screens
   Using MaterialApp's home property
   The simplest way to set the first screen.
   Example:
   MaterialApp(
   home: HomeScreen(),
   )
   Navigating to Another Screen
   Use Navigator.push to go to a new screen.
   Use Navigator.pop to return.
   // Navigate to SecondScreen
   Navigator.push(
   context,
   MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
   );

// Go back
Navigator.pop(context);
When to use home vs initialRoute?
Use home for simple apps with a single entry point.
Use initialRoute when you want to control the first screen dynamically or use named routes.

4.Named Routes and Route Management
   What are Named Routes?
   Named routes use string identifiers for screens.
   Defined in the routes table of MaterialApp.
   Example:

MaterialApp(
initialRoute: '/',
routes: {
'/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
'/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
},
)

// Navigate using a name
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second');
When to Use Named Routes?
For larger apps with many screens
When you want to decouple navigation logic from widget creation
For deep linking and navigation from outside the app
Route Management
You can use onGenerateRoute for dynamic route generation
Useful for passing arguments or handling unknown routes
Example:

MaterialApp(
onGenerateRoute: (settings) {
if (settings.name == '/second') {
final args = settings.arguments as ScreenArguments;
return MaterialPageRoute(
builder: (context) {
return SecondScreen(
data: args.data,
);
},
);
}
// Handle other routes
return null;
},
)

5.Sending Data While Navigating and Receiving in Other Screen
   Passing Data with Constructor
   Navigator.push(
   context,
   MaterialPageRoute(
   builder: (context) => SecondScreen(data: 'Hello'),
   ),
   );

// In SecondScreen
class SecondScreen extends StatelessWidget {
final String data;
const SecondScreen({Key? key, required this.data}) : super(key: key);
// ...
}
Passing Data with Named Routes
Use the arguments parameter
Navigator.pushNamed(
context,
'/second',
arguments: ScreenArguments('Hello'),
);

// In SecondScreen, access via ModalRoute
final args = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as ScreenArguments;

6.Navigating with Arguments
   Why Use Arguments?
   To pass complex data between screens
   To keep navigation logic clean and scalable
   Example:

// Define an arguments class
class ScreenArguments {
final String message;
ScreenArguments(this.message);
}

// Pass arguments
Navigator.pushNamed(
context,
'/second',
arguments: ScreenArguments('Hello from first screen!'),
);

// Receive arguments in the target screen
final args = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as ScreenArguments;

7.Advanced: When to Use What?
   Approach Use Case
   home property Simple apps, single entry point
   initialRoute Dynamic entry, onboarding, auth flows
   Named routes Large apps, deep linking, decoupled navigation
   onGenerateRoute Dynamic routes, passing arguments, error handling
   Passing via constructor Simple data passing, tightly coupled screens
   Passing via arguments Complex data, decoupled navigation
8.Best Practices and Tips
   Keep navigation logic outside of UI code when possible
   Use named routes for scalability
   Use onGenerateRoute for dynamic or guarded navigation
   Always handle unknown routes for better UX
   Use arguments for passing data, especially with named routes
   For complex apps, consider navigation packages like go_router or auto_route 
9.Summary
   Navigation is central to multi-screen Flutter apps
   Start with basic navigation, then move to named routes and argument passing as your app grows
   Understand the role of Navigator, home, initialRoute, and route tables
   Choose the right approach for your appâ€™s complexity and requirements
